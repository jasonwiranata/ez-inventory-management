"# ez-inventory-management" 
"# ez-inventory-management is an application for small - medium scale metal industries to help them manage their production and transcation progress, we use realtime database provided by firebase to store the data. This is a project that we made for Google Bangkit Capstone Project Submission. At first we want to store the data at GCP using BigQuery Features, but we only know how to make an API to pull the data and dont know how to make an API to store the data in GCP BigQuery, so we decided to use firebase realtime database"


1. What we had tried : 
    - We had tried to make the login feature, but the app wont go to the next activity after login
    - We had tried to connect the database to firebase realtime database, but the data wont store in the database

2. Features that need to be upgraded :
    - Login feature
    - Filter feature
    - Validation feature
    - Machine learning feature to analyze and give estimation on how much the company should produce certain product

3. What can be done differently :
    - Use GCP's BigQuery to store and pull the data (The commited API can only pull the data from the GCP's BigQuery)
